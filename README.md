*  [FTDI](https://github.com/JITx-Inc/FTDI) - Circuits for FTDI components, including parts like the FT2232HL

# Fabrication

*  [JLC PCB](https://github.com/JITx-Inc/jlc-pcb) - Stackups, vias, and impedance controlled designs for JLCPCB

# Libraries

*  [libcurl](https://github.com/StanzaOrg/slm-curl) - Make HTTPS requests
*  [libarchive](https://github.com/StanzaOrg/slm-libarchive) - Create Tar/Zip files
*  [libjson](https://github.com/StanzaOrg/slm-json) - Parse/Create [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files/strings
*  [term-colors](https://github.com/StanzaOrg/term-colors) - Create Colored Text in the Commandline Terminal
*  [maybe-utils](https://github.com/StanzaOrg/maybe-utils) - Tools for working with `Maybe<>` types
